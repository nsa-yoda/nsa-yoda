## Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught coder and lifelong learner. Born in the Dominican Republic, raised in the South Bronx, and currently somewhere in New Jersey, I thrive on exploring new skills â€” from cooking and music to programming.

My coding journey started at 11 years old, and has so far lead me to roles at Touro College, Borderfree, and Shutterstock - amongst others, and worked on very interesting projects including for the USDOD, Lucille Roberts, Beaba USA, and NJOP.
