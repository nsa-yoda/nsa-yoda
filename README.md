## Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm âœ¨ Juan âœ¨, a self-taught coder and lifelong learner ðŸŒ±. Born in the Dominican Republic, raised in the South Bronx, and currently somewhere in New Jersey, I thrive on exploring new skillsâ€”from cooking and music ðŸŽ¸ to programming ðŸ’».

My coding journey started in middle school, leading to roles at Touro College, Borderfree, and Shutterstock - amongst others.
